# Password-Storage
 
Python password storage application built using cryptography module for encryption, tkinter for gui and a combination of sqlite3 and object pickling to store data.

This is a personal practice project to practice core fundamentals before moving onto more complex projects.

In order to run you must first run the SQL initialization function to generate the database. From there you can use the GUI for full functionality (work in progress).
